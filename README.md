# Ada Named Parameter Issue

This example demonstrates a common error in Ada involving named parameters when calling functions with multiple parameters.

Ada, unlike some other languages, requires you to explicitly name parameters when using multiple parameters.  The code illustrates the correct and incorrect methods for calling a function to calculate the area of a rectangle.

The `bug.ada` file shows the incorrect usage, which will result in a compilation error.  The solution is provided in `bugSolution.ada`.
